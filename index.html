            Peter Parker was an orphaned teenage boy who lived in Queens, New York with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. He was a shy boy, but highly intelligent and excelled in science. ... The spider bite gave Peter spider-like powers with super strength and reflexes. He also had a “spider-sense” alerting him to danger.
