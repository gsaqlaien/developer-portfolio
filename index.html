                Peter Parker was an orphaned teenage boy who lived in Queens, New York with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben.
                He
                was a shy boy, but highly intelligent and excelled in science. ... The spider bite gave Peter
                spider-like
                powers with super strength and reflexes. He also had a “spider-sense” alerting him to danger.

            <h2>Spider Man Creation & development</h2>
            <h3>Spider man Series</h3>
            <p>
                Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is
                The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York
                City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in
                the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers. Doctor Octopus
                also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter
                appears to die.[10] Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man,
                including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future;
                Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe;
                and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of
                Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death. Miles later became a popular superhero in his
                own right, and was brought into the mainstream continuity, where he sometimes works alongside Peter.
